There are three kinds of tracks:

* **Self-study tracks**:
  * **What**: These are are course materials introducing topics which you can study on your own or in a group. They are not targeted at specific jobs, but can help broaden your knowledge.
  * **When**: You can study these tracks any time. They list what you need to know before starting.
* **Tracks for jobs after ITP**:
  * **What**: These are course materials targeting specific jobs.
  * **Who**: You must have completed the Introduction to Programming course, be enrolled as a trainee, and want the job it's targeting.\
  If you are planning to do the Software Development Course, you probably want to prepare for the Piscine and SDC rather than taking one of these tracks.
  * **When**: When a job requiring one of these tracks is available, CYF will announce when the track will run.
* **Tracks for jobs after SDC**:
  * **What**: These are course materials targeting specific jobs.
  * **Who**: You must have completed the Software Development Course, be enrolled as a trainee, and want the job it's targeting.
  * **When**: When a job requiring one of these tracks is available, CYF will announce when the track will run.
