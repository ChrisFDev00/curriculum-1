# The Setup

Get everyone standing for this exercise!

1. Start off by everyone demonstrating unconfident poses
2. Get everyone moving with a quick stretch or power pose to break the ice and release tension. 
 - Superman pose – feet shoulder-width apart, hands on hips, chest out.
 - The victor - hands up in the air in a V and feet apart
 - Any others

3. In a power pose of your chosing go around the room and ask everyone to say their name in the most exaggerated, enthusiastic way possible, like they’re introducing themselves to a stadium of people.
