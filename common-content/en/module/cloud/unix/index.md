### Why must I learn Linux?

Almost all servers in the world run Linux. Mac OS and Linux are both POSIX systems, a subset of UNIX, and most commands are the same on these systems. Windows works differently. To work in Devops, and Cloud you need to be familiar with Linux and the command line.

Most devices run Linux, in one way or another, like your smart tv, your phone, your fridge. Linux is the operating system that runs everything. It is ubiquitous.

Start exploring Linux by reading [Ops School: Shell 101](https://www.opsschool.org/shell_tools_101.html) and playing [The Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).
