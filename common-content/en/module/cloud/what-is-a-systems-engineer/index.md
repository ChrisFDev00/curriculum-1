This term covers many different roles and specialisms. In the abstract, you design, build, and secure the systems and then you connect them to each other. This is what makes them engineers as opposed to sysadmins, who maintain systems but do not create them.

Systems engineers can work in these areas: Cloud, DevOps, DevSecOps, Architecture, Automation, Pipelines...and more.

### What do they need to know?

Systems engineers need to grasp the complexities of the systems behind the faces of websites and networks. For example: servers connect by IP address, but IP addresses are hard for humans to remember. We came up with domain names to make it easier to find things, but behind the scenes there is still huge complexity. A systems engineer must work to grasp that complexity.

A systems engineer understands _how the internet works_.
