Most people have a router at home, or a phone with a hotspot, for example. The router is translating between networks. You can think of it like a roundabout: you connect many roads to a roundabout and the traffic can flow in many different directions.

If you donâ€™t have a roundabout, you cannot leave the road you are on. If you donâ€™t have a router, you cannot leave the network you are on.

So networking is the work of connecting things; it's building a complex, interlocking system.

Connecting devices is complicated. There are several [layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) involved, called OSI layers, which are a bit like Russian dolls, each one inside the other. You will unpeel the layers slowly to understand this in this topic, but the important thing to start with is to understand that servers are useless by themselves; we have to connect them up.
